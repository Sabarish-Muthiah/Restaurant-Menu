# Restaurant-Menu
Hello! 
This program is a basic and simple project of a Restaurant Menu system. First it asks to input the amount of money the user has available. Then the program outputs the different varieties of cuisines offered from the menu. This program asks the user to choose a dish and input the dish's code number as seen in the menu. After the user inputs the code number of a chosen dish, the price of the dish gets outputted. Lastly, the modified net worth of the user if they buy the dish gets outputted.
In this program, I have used the common concepts of Cout, Cin, Switch, Case, Break etc. 
Thanks for viewing thiis program.
